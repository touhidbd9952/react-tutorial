//////upload React project in cpanel///////

To upload a React project to a shared hosting environment like cPanel, you need to follow these steps:
---
1. Build Your React Project
Run the build command in your React project root:
npm run build
This creates a build/ folder containing static files.
---
2. Zip the Build Folder
Zip the contents of the build folder (not the folder itself):
cd build
zip -r ../react-app.zip ./*
---
3. Upload to cPanel
1. Log into your cPanel account.
2. Open the File Manager.
3. Go to the public_html/ directory (or a subdomain folder).
4. Upload the react-app.zip file.
5. Once uploaded, Extract the ZIP file.
6. Ensure all files (index.html, static/, etc.) are directly inside public_html/.

4. (Optional) Configure .htaccess for Routing
If you're using React Router, you need to configure .htaccess:
Create or edit the .htaccess file in public_html/ and add:
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
This ensures React handles routing instead of showing 404 errors on refresh.
---
5. Access Your App
Now go to:
https://yourdomain.com
You should see your React app live!
